// I learned that there are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array. Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line
