//I learned you can insert one or more variables into a string with the concatenate operator (+)

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Kate"
var myStr = "My name is" + myName + " " + "and I am well!"
