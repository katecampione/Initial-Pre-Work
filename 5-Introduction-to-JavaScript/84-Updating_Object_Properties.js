//I learned that after you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.name = "Happy Camper";

// Setup
var myDog = {
  "name": "Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

// Only change code below this line.
myDog.name = "Happy Coder"; // Updated the myDog objects name property
