//I learned we can concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable with the += operator

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence.";
 myStr += " "
 myStr += "This is the second sentence."
