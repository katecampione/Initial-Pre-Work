// I learned that JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and not quite up to 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never quite return a 1.

function randomFraction() {

  // Only change code below this line.

  return Math.random();

  // Only change code above this line.
}
