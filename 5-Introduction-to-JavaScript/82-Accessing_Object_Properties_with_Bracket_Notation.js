//I learned that if the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation. However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line

var entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];   // Change this line
var drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];    // Change this line
