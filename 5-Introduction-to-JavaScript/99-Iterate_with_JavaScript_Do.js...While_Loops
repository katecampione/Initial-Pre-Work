// I learned that a do...while loop will pass the code through the loop no matter what ("do") then it will run ("while") a specified condition is true and stop when it is false.

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

do  {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);
