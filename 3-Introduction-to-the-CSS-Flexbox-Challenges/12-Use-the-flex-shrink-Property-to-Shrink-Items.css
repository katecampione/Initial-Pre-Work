/*I learned flex-shrink will shrink the children of the flex-container if the flex-container is too small. The flex-shrink property takes numbers as values and the higher the number, the greater it will shrink. Example, if one item has a flex-shrink value of 1 and the other has a flex-shrink value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will shrink three times as much as the other.*/
